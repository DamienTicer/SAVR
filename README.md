# SAVR
This case study focuses on our tool Savr, a financial tracking and budgeting application tailored to meet the needs of college students. Savr aims to assist students with managing their diverse income sources, such as part-time jobs, scholarships, and student loans.  It can help track expenses, set savings goals, and monitor loan payments. Savr aims to provide a comprehensive platform to improve financial literacy and help students make informed financial decisions during college.
We aim to explore the development and implementation of Savr, highlighting its features, user requirements, system architecture, and future evolution plans. The case study would serve as a blueprint for creating Savr while offering insights into effective budgeting, financial literacy resources, and strategies for addressing students' common financial challenges. 
College students often struggle with managing their finances due to variable income sources and fluctuating expenses. Challenges include tracking daily spending, staying within monthly budgets, managing student loans, and saving for future goals.
